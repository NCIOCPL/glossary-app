Feature: Redirect to Pretty URL Definition Page

Scenario: As a user, if my term's page URL contains an ID, I would like to be redirected to the termâ€™s page with a pretty URL name.
  Given the user is viewing the definition with the ID "44058"
  Then the user is redirected to "/def/metastatic"
  And the system appends '?redirect=true' to the URL
